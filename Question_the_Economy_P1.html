<h2>Inflation or Deflation?</h2>

<h3>Bubble Territory?</h3>
<p>
As of today on Tuesday, September 15th, 2020, the stock market had a bit of a bounce since the S&amp;P index 
retraced 7% from its all time high of 3580 set two weeks ago. Meanwhile, home real estate prices (on average) across the US have seen all-time highs. 
According to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller US National Home Price Index, the index currently sits at around 220, well surpassing the 2006 levels of 180. 
And remember that the housing bubble popped from 2007-2008 in the Great Financial Crisis.

<hr>

<p>Despite the record highs in stocks and housing prices, we cannot deny that we are now in an economic recession. In Q2 of 2020, US GDP fell a record high 32.9%, 
the highest ever recorded in modern US history. Although the government-defined unemployment rate has been declining from its record high in April 2020 at 14.7% 
(according to the US Bureau of Labor and Statistics), unemployment is still high at around 8.4%. Just because the unemployment figures are less worse, 
does not mean the situation is good. Questions people have in mind are: 
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Are we in a massive bubble?</li>
	<li>Is this the calm before the storm, much like what was experienced in the roaring 20s leading up to the Great Depression in 1929?</li>
	<li>Are we headed for inflation or deflation?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Are we Headed for Inflation or Deflation?</h3>
<p>
Since the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, the Federal Reserve has set interest rates to record lows at essentially 0%. The Fed has also continued 
its quantitative easing (QE) policy of printing digital dollars into the banking reserves. Are these bank reserves being injected to the real economy?
Or are banks unwilling to lend out money due to the unstable economic situation and low return from Fed-imposed interest rates? What are the headwinds and 
tailwinds? Tune in next time for the next episode of <strong>Question the Economy</strong>!

<em>Description: This is an entertaining representation (and meme) of what the Fed does daily through QE. Although the Fed does not actually print 
dollar bills out, the Fed does inject liquidity in the form of bank reserves.</em>
