	<h2>Deflation During Low Interest Rates and QE?</h2>
	
<article>
	<h3>Banks Tightening Lending</h3>
<p>
This discussion explores the theory that banks are refusing to lend out to customers for two main reasons:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>low interest rate</li>
	<li>uncertainty from the economic impacts of COVID-19</li>
</ul>

<p>
Despite the low interest rates the Federal Reserve has set to encourage borrowers to take on loans, banks are doing the opposite and tightening lending. Banks are requiring stricter loan requirements such as higher net savings, accessibility to retirement accounts, and strict employment and income verification. Moreoever, banks are demanding higher down payments or higher rates before loaning out to potential home buyers. 
</p>

<p>
Low interest rates translate to lower returns. Because of the Fed-controlled interest rates, banks are receiving lower amounts from interest payment.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, banks also have a poor economic outlook due to the uncertainty as COVID-19 continues to ravage the global economy. When borrowers are not financially stable, they have higher risk of defaulting on loans. This means that the banks (the lenders) will lose money when borrowers default and have nothing else to offer as collateral. 
</p>

<p>
Millions of people are out of work, and infections continue to surge throughout the country. Certain industries like the service and restaurant industries are on the brink of collapse because of government restrictions (i.e., lockdowns, maximum occupancies, social distancing intended to combat the pandemic. All of this is happening while banks such as JP Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo have set aside billions of dollars. So why are banks hoarding so much cash? Well, it's very possible that they fear a tusnami of loan defaults will happen, and they want to be prepared for the worst.

	<h3>Fed vs Banks Tug of War: Inflationary Forces vs Deflationary Forces</h3>
<p>
Through quantitative easing, the Fed is creating more bank reserves in hopes of driving inflation up. Moreover, on August 7th, 2020, the Fed's chairman Jerome Powell announced that they would allow the inflation rate to go past the standard 2%. It certainly seems that the Fed is aiming for higher inflation targets. However, unless banks create loans, "new money" will not circulate into the economy and add to the money supply and velocity to drive up inflation. Contrary to popular belief, quantitative easing does not print new dollar bills directly into the economy. So how does this all work?
</p>

<p>
First, let's define bank reserves. Bank reserves are created when the Fed buys bonds from the banks. In return, the Fed credits the banks' reserve accounts held at and administered by the Fed. Surprisingly, banks cannot access these bank reserves, let alone withdraw reserves as cash. The reserves held at the Fed are attributed to the banks by name only. Essentially, bank reserves are simply collateral accounts. The only way for banks to use the reserves is if they lend against their own capital, but banks already have so much cash they choose not to carry this added risk. 
</p>

<p>
In essence, bank reserves are liabilities held by the Fed. And because these are liabilities, the Fed cannot exchange these for cash or use them to buy other bonds. Therefore, quantitative easing can actually be seen as deflationary because the Fed is sucking liquidity out from banks. 

However, the perceived notion that quantiative easing prints money alone contributes to the inflationary psychology becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Demand for goods may be driven up as consumers expect greater inflation in the future, buying as much as they can in the present while expecting the value of their currency decreasing or the price of goods increasing into the future.

<p>
Many economists would argue that the only true way to create money is through the creation of debt, also known as credit. Now let's explore the topic of how banks create money out of 'thin air' by issuing debt.
</p>

<p>
When there's more debt created, "new money" is added to the economy. The banks hold the same money they had to begin with, but new debt is added to the banks' balance sheets as liabilities. Meanwhile, the same debt that was created is free to be used by the borrower, which then can circulate into the greater economy. 

For instance, a business owner borrows $100,000 from a bank and spends the money on renovating her shop. In turn, money goes toward paying for the labor costs and supplies. Eventually, the money the renovators earned as well as the money the material suppliers receive can be used to pay their own employees who then use the trickled down pay to consume goods like groceries and clothing. This money, in turn, also drives economic activity into the supermarkets selling the groceries and the retail stores selling the clothing. The single act of the debt creation eventually ends up circulating into the larger economy and driving up economic activity as a whole. This is why debt is actually seen as an economic driver, at least in the short term.

<em>Description: Because commercial banks and the Federal Reserve have opposing interests, one can think of the relationship between the two as a tug-of-war. While the Federal Reserve wants a low interest rate environment to support an inflationary bubble from collapsing, the banks want a higher interest rate environment for higher returns. And while the Federal Reserve wants credit and debt to expand and keep the economy from collapsing, banks are not lending and are actually contributing to deflation.</em>

	<h2>Future Digital Dollar?</h2>

<article>
	<h3>Why the Government Would Support a US Digital Dollar</h3>
</article>

<p>
The current banking system relies on cash and bank reserves to work. This means that the Federal Reserve requires cooperation from banks to fulfill its agenda. But what if the Federal Reserve can circumvent banks by issuing their own 'FedCoin' directly to the mass populace as a means to inject monetary supply directly into the economy? Moving to a cashless society—a society running on digitalized US dollars—would certainly favor the Federal Reserve's control. 

There's a well known saying by the former UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill, "Never let a good crisis go to waste." COVID-19 may just be the opportune crisis the government and the Federal Reserve can exploit to manuever closer to a cashless society. By pointing to fears of spreading the virus (and other germs) via physical cash and a more efficient currency system, the government can then justify moving toward a digitalized dollar system. Furthermore, the move to a digital US dollar also eliminates the cost associated with printing paper dollars and producing coins. 
</p>

<article>
	<h3>Possible Outcomes</h3>
</article>

<p>
While other governments like the Chinese government have already begun test trials of their own digitalized currency, the US government and the Federal Reserve have been mulling over whether to move to a digital dollar. If the US were to move even in part to a digital dollar, the Federal Reserve and the government would have greater control over the US dollar and money velocity. 
</p>

<p>
For instance, if we were to receive another stimulus check from the government but in the form of digitalized dollars associated with our personal 'FedCoin' account, the government could stipulate that we are only allowed to use the stimulus for purchasing certain goods. Moreover, the government could also require that we spend the stimulus amount within a narrow time frame. These criteria for the stimulus would certainly make sense if the Federal Reserve is trying to achieve higher inflation targets by forcing greater consumption and velocity of transactions within the greater economy. By not allowing us to deposit the stimulus in our bank accounts, the stimulus payments would have to be spent into the economy. 
</p>

<p>
The additional incentive of having a completely cashless society is that the government can monitor all digital transactions. Though it would mean less privacy and freedom for US citizens, the government would be able to track all transactions whether for tax purposes or even surveillance. Normal cash transactions like paying a friend in cash would no longer go undetected under a full digitalized dollar system. Every digital transaction would be recorded and possibly scrutinized for tax payments.
